          <p class="tquote boxtext">I can't recommend Tar Heel Roofing and Solar enough. Josh and Kadir made sure we received outstanding service. Even though the date was pushed out a week because of inclement weather, once they started they replaced our roof within the days they stated. We had the roof replaced during the COVID19 pandemic so the response from our insurance company was very slow to say the least, but the contractor was patient every step of the way.
            <br>
            My concern was the cleanup process, a neighbor of mine had their roof replaced with another contractor and was telling me about his battle with finding numerous nails on his lawn after the job was complete. I expressed that concern to the contractor and they made sure to thoroughly clean up after the job was complete. During the original roof removal, some shingles hit the siding of our house when falling and others hit one or two our screen windows.
            They came out the following day with workers to repair the screen windows and clean/retouch the siding that was marred with the falling shingles.</p>

              Gutters are a critical part of the home. Designed to keep water flowing
    away from the house, quality gutters will prevent water from backing up
    under the shingles as well as pooling up around the foundation.
    <br>
    We offer 5 inch oversized gutters, which handle heavy downpours more
    effectively than a standard 4 inch gutter. We offer a variety of colors and
    styles. Gutter guards provide additional protection for homes that are
    surrounded by foliage.

              If your home is surrounded by trees and foliage, you may benefit from
              gutter guards. These guards prevent debris from accumulating in the gutter,
              which could cause water to back up and overflow under the shingles,
              causing ceiling line stains and rotted fascia.
              <br>
              There are many different kinds of gutter guards, ranging from high quality
              steel mesh to more affordable vinyl and PVC. Different environments callfor different materials, we are here to help you make the best choice for
              your home.

        Tar Heel specializes in repairs of all kinds, whether it be missing shingles,
        flashing damage, or a leak of unknown origin. Our repair process is as
        follows:
        <br>
        We first conduct a thorough inspection, being sure to document everything
        we see. You can follow this documentation live, as we conduct the
        inspection, via a project link we provide to you. Depending on the issues
        specific to your home, we will conduct a drone or physical inspection. Post
        inspection our consultant will discuss in detail everything found. Our goals
        are simple: to thoroughly document the roof’s condition and to inform and
        educate you along the way.

          Roof Replacement</span>
      <p class="textpara box">
        Replacing a roof requires a lot of moving parts. There is the ground crew,
        responsible for cleaning and dumping debris and trash. Atop the roof are
        the roofers, as well as the roofing assistants. The assistants manage the
        continual flow of material, making sure roofers have plenty of nails and
        shingles. They also catch debris, and pass it down to the ground crew. The
        roofers, well, they roof.
        <br>
        We know our clients won’t climb the roof to make sure we are completing
        everything as per the contract. To remedy this, we provide detailed drone
        photos highlighting key components of the install process. While this givespeace of mind, it also ensures the roof will be covered under the
        manufacturer's warranty. We offer both GAF and Certainteed warranties,
        which have a 50 year length, and are transferable if and when you decide
        to sell your home. GAF and Certainteed are the nation's largest
        manufacturers of shingles, both have been in business for over one
        hundred years.
