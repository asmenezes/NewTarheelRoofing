Managing where the water goes is almost as important as the roof itself, as keeping water out of your home through your roofing system is the first and most important line of defense. However, when that water comes sheeting off your roofing system, it can cause major problems, including erosion, pooling at the foundations, and inconveniences at entry points, among other issues. Tar Heel Roofing and Solar insists on the best for our customers, so we install top-rated gutters and gutter guard products that provide years of reliable performance. Our gutter installers have decades of experience and are capable of tackling even the most complex of projects. We not only fabricate our systems on-site to ensure you have a custom strategy that works for your home, but we also protect your investment with some of the best warranties in the business.

              If you suspect that your home has suffered storm damage and you plan to file an insurance claim, it's important to obtain a damage report to increase your chances of approval. At Tar Heel Roofing and Solar, we provide comprehensive roof inspections to assess the damage to property caused by hail, ice, or wind. Our experienced roofing contractors use a combination of innovative technologies, including satellite photos and drones, to create a detailed and accurate damage report. This report provides photographic evidence of the roof damage and can be used to support your insurance claim. We can also guide you through the process of filing your storm damage insurance claim.
